So you could sit there in this hurt
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
You told your family for a reason
Dom PÃ©rignon, you brought it
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
November flush and your flannel cure
I never was ready, so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
